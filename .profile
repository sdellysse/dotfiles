# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.

# The latest version as installed by the Cygwin Setup program can
# always be found at /etc/defaults/etc/skel/.profile

# Modifying /etc/skel/.profile directly will prevent
# setup from updating it.

# The copy in your home directory (~/.profile) is yours, please
# feel free to customise it to create a shell
# environment to your liking.  If you feel a change
# would be benificial to all, please feel free to send
# a patch to the cygwin mailing list.
